                <p>
                    I am currently a student at John Abbott College in the third year of the Computer Science program.
                    During my years of education, I have garnered a substantial amount of professional skills, such as
                    problem solving, working in a team, and accurately planning out work in advance.<br /><br />
                    I work and have worked with a multitude of different programming languages and technologies. For
                    instance, I have done a lot of database design, creation, and management, a lot of programming (in
                    Java, C#, and many more), and a lot of web development. I have also learnt a lot during my
                    internship about React, TypeScript, and Spring Boot.

                <h1>ProletariRat</h1>
                <p>A game about a humble rat magically endowed with superpowers trying to survive in the heart of Paris
                    by defeating rude customers in a famous restaurant. Story and setting heavily inspired by the 2007
                    film Ratatouille and loosely relating to concepts of class disadvantages. The game is played using
                    the HTML canvas, created almost purely in JavaScript, and designed with basic game development
                    concepts in mind. Don't forget to unmute the tab to hear the lovely music and I hope you enjoy!

                    <p>Most people probably know the famous New York Times game titled "Wordle". Every day, it gives the
                        user 6 tries to guess the word by putting in guesses and seeing which letters were wrong, which
                        partly right, or which in the correct spot. Well, no longer do people need to think of the words
                        themselves since the script I have written in python does everything for them, down to the
                        opening of the window and the typing of the guesses. It uses a very primitive way of searching,
                        I will admit, but it works!<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/AlexeiDanelyuk/wordle-solver"

                <h1>Wonderful Events</h1>
                <p>This project was one completed in a team of three people, which is just as well because it was a big
                    one: designing and creating a website with several data types that each have CRUD functionality
                    while also making the website look user-friendly. My team and I take great pride in how it turned
                    out, both visually and functionally. With its vibrant and joyful colors, it stands out in the sea of
                    dark mode-styled websites that comprise the overwhelming majority of modern website designs. Not
                    only that, the website has a lot of function and manages to do all of that without bugs. It is not
                    perfect, but it was made with love. <br /><br /><a
